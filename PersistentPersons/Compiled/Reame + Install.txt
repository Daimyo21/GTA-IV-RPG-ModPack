	*Money on character
	*Player Position in the world
-Walk in multiplayer!
-Arrest Reward system that rewards players money for using LCPDFRs arrest system (change reward amounts in INI)
-Simple and fast police skin selector, (No need to use a bloated trainer, or run to the police station)
-Auto Save feature that will continually save every X amount of seconds set by the player
-Force Save feature so you can save on the spot
-Auto Load feature that will load your character data when script loads
-Customizable Controls/Settings

Installation:

Copy the PersistentPersons.net and PersistentPersons.INI file + PersistentPersonsSave.INI files into your scripts folder.


General CREDITS:
-AngryAmoeba, his scripts like Bank Account, Weapon Weight and Weapon storage inspired me a ton and are wonderful solid scripts. 
I've talked to Angry and he is super cool, allowing me to re-release some of his scripts with added functionality.
Some of his functionality is burrowed/modified in the persistent portions of my scripts as well as his ATM locator functionality in my PvP Wanted scripts hospital respawn functionality.

LCPDFR.com, without your mod and support, none of this would be possible!
